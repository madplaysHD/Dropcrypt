Thank you for downloading dropcrypt.
Dropcrypt is open source software developed
by Mattis Zbigniew Haase.

Dropcrypt is currently in ALPHA, it SHOULD NOT
BE USED FOR SENSITIVE DATA. USE THIS SOFTWARE
AT YOUR OWN RISK. I DO NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSI-
BILITY FOR DAMAGE CAUSED BY THIS SOFTWARE

THE POSSIBILITY OF DATA LOSS EXISTS, BACKUP
YOUR DATA

Seriously, this thing basically sucks in the current 
version, it might cause your computer to explode or
something


Install:

1. unpack everything into a folder. Apparently
you already did that because you are reading
this
2. open the config.ini
3. make a new folder where your UNENCRYPTED
files should be, this CANNOT BE INSIDE YOUR
DROPBOX FOLDER.
4. Copy the entire content of your dropboxfolder into
your local folder
5. empty your dropboxfolder.
6. in the config.ini under 'local' put the COMPLETE
PATH TO THIS LOCAL FOLDER i.e. local=C:\local
7. under 'destination' put your dropbox folder, i.e.
destination=C:\dropbox
8. save the config file
9. open the file called "keyfile"
10. simply type your password in. length is the most
important factor. the password has to be the same
on all your machines or you might destroy your data.
11. Install python 2.7
12. run a commandline, go to your dropcrypt 
folder and type "python dropcrypt.py"
13. thats it, its running, wait until sync is comp-
lete before doing stuff.
14. DONT CLOSE THE WINDOW. Otherwise, dataloss 
might occur. There is not really a way to securely
close the program at the moment. Just make sure
that nothing is writing to your local folder at the 
moment.



This software is open source and written as 
verbose and clear as possible so even progra-
mming illeterate people have a chance to under-
stand what its doing. I feel it is important that
everybody understands his own security-
critical software.

Have fun.
